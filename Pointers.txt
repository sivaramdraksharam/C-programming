Pointers
-----------
	A Pointer is a variable, which points to another variable. Using pointers, we can hold the address of variables.
	We use the following 2 operators to work with pointers
& --> ampersand-- to get the address
* --> asterisk --- to get the value of that address

	We use Pointers for 2 reasons:
1. To catch the address of the variables to improve the speed of the accessing of the program.
2. To hold unlimited values so that we can overcome the drawbacks of an array.

	Pointer Variables are dymanic in nature.

Declaration of Pointer Variables:
----------------------------------------
int *p;
char *q;
float *n;

Initialiazation of Pointer Variables:
-------------------------------------------
int x=5;
int *p=&x;

or

int *p;
--
---
p=&x;


Pointer Arithmetic:
-----------------------

1. Increment/Decrement with Pointers: 

int *p;	p++ (p=p+1)-->the value of p incremented by 2
float *q 	q++ -->the value of q incremented by 4

2. Addition and Subtraction with Pointers:
	-We cant add one pointer variable to another pointer variable. its a compilation error.
	int *p,*q;
		p+q; -- error
		p=42	
		p+2; --> 46 

	-But we can subtract one pointer variable to another pointer variable only when both pointers point to the same array.

Pointer using Functions:
------------------------------

There are 2 ways to call functions
1. Call by Value
2. Call by Reference
