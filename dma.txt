There are 2 ways to allocate memory
1. Static Memory Allocation
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation

Static Memory Allocation(SMA):
	Allocating memory at the time of declaration of variable is known as Static Memory Allocation.
for ex: Arrays.

Dynamic Memory Allocation(DMA):
	Allocating memory at the time of execution of the program is known as Dynamic Memory Allocation.
for ex: Pointers.


C supports the following DMA functions.

1. malloc():
	It allocates the required memory and set the control pointer at the begining address.
2. calloc():
	It is similar to malloc(), but it fills the default value 0.
3. realloc():
	It re-allocates the memory to the variable.
4. free():
	It releases the allocated memory.

	The above 3 functions returns NULL, if the requested memory is not available in the disk.
