File Handling in C:
-------------------
	We know that the data stored in the variables is not permanent. once you terminate from the program the data u entered in the variables is no longer available. In order to make the data permanent so that the data can be retrieved later, C Language supports Files concept.

File Operations:
----------------

1. Creating a file.
2. Opening a file.
3. Writing data to the file.
4. Reading data from the file.
5. Closing the file.

1. Creating a File:
--------------------
	To create a file, declare the pointer variable of FILE datatype.
	
	FILE *fptr;

2. Opening file:
-------------------
	fopen(): This function is used to open the file

	syn: fopen("filename","mode");

	modes:
		w --> write mode
		r --> read mode
		a --> append mode
		w+ --> write and read
		a+ --> append and read
		r+ --> read and write


	ex: fptr=fopen("myfile.txt","r");

Note:	The fopen() returns NULL if the specified file is not in the disk.

3. Writing data to the file:
----------------------------
	fputc() : to write a character to the file
	fprintf() : to write a formatted string to the file
	fwrite() : to write a record to the file

4. Reading data from the file:
------------------------------
	fgetc() : to read a character from the file.
	fscanf() : to read a formatted string from the file
	fread() : to read a record from the file

5. Closing the file:
--------------------
	After performing the above operations u must close the file.
	fclose(): to close the file.
	
	ex: fclose(fptr);

	
Detecting End of the file:
--------------------------
	EOF: to detect the end of the text files.
	feof(): to detect the end of the data files.
